# Current Song to Slack

When this script is compiled as an application, it will send the song/artist currently playing
in Spotify, Rdio, or iTunes to the specified Slack channel. Incoming WebHooks for Slack
must be enabled.

When in Script Editor.app use File > Export... and choose type 'Application'. Click the checkbox 'Stay open after run handler'. 

## TODO

* Test if media is streaming over airplay (can't do without opening iTunes)
